# PDL_ALM_DL_code  

## Introduction
Predual dictionary learning (PDL) / augmented Lagrangian multi-scale dictionary learning(ALM-DL)  

## About our code
The Code is created based on the method described in the following papers:   
This idea was originally motivated from the predual dictionary learning (PDL)【1】  
Later, we found that it also can be derived from the view of augmented Lagrangian【2】  
【2】is the advanced version, termed ALM-DL:augmented Lagrangian multi-scale dictionary learning
