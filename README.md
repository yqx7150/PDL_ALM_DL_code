# PDL_ALM_DL_code
predual dictionary learning (PDL) / augmented Lagrangian multi-scale dictionary learning(ALM-DL)  
%% The Code is created based on the method described in the following papers:   
%  This idea was originally motivated from the predual dictionary learning (PDL)【1】  
%  Later, we found that it also can be derived from the view of augmented Lagrangian【2】  
% 【2】is the advanced version, termed ALM-DL:augmented Lagrangian multi-scale dictionary learning
